// We try to minimize the use of signals and slots exposed to QML,
// so we FacebookImageDownloader only expose one method in C++.
// This method exposes the FacebookImageDownloaderWorkerObject.
//
// The FacebookImageDownloaderWorkerObject is used to perform
// download of Facebook images, and notify that images are downloaded,
// so that models can be notified and be changed.
//
// This object lives in a different thread, so it should communicates
// with other objects using signals and slots. The important signals
// and slots are FacebookImageDownloaderWorkerObject::queue and
// FacebookImageDownloaderWorkerObject::dataUpdated.
//
// The call path that is being done is
// FacebookImageWorkerObject::refresh calls FacebookImageWorkerObject::queue.
// This triggers an emission of requestQueue. This signal is connected to
// FacebookImageDownloaderWorkerObject::queue, so FacebookImageDownloaderWorkerObject
// starts downloading data. When data is downloaded,
// FacebookImageDownloaderWorkerObject::dataUpdated is sent, and triggers
// FacebookImageCacheModelPrivate::slotDataUpdated that changes the model.
//
// Basically we communicates between internal objects, and never touch the
// QML API.
